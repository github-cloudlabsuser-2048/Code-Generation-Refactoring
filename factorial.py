    Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer.

    The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
    It is denoted by n! and defined as:
    - 0! = 1
    - n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1 for n > 0

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input is a negative integer.
